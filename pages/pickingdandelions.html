				<br><p>Picking Dandelions is a collection of 99 poems that are written and illustrated by myself, depicting my journey with heart break, living with depression, and surviving a suicide attempt.</p>
				<p>The collection of poems are free form and most often written in bed by the light of my phone in the late hours of the night spilling into the morning. The collection is split into three chapters, ABNORMAL, BROKEN, and FLOATING, each representing a different part of my journey. Sprinkled throughout the book are also my personal illustrations.</p>
