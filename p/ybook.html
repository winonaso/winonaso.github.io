				<h1>Britannia's 2009 - 2010 Yearbook</h1>
					<p>In my final year of high school, I was chosen to become the editor-in-chief of my school yearbook. This would be a huge task, with deadlines and milestones, and it was an incredibly hectic time of my life. As it is now complete and over, I've decided to use the SWOT analysis technique to take a look back at my time as EIC. The SWOT analysis technique will help reflect on whats worked out well, what didn't, and maybe what opportunities I missed or threats I could have faced.
      <p>Strengths: The strengths of my yearbook were the design, organization, and sales. The design was because I had a team of strong design students, who were willing to listen to criticism, and alter their work. Although it took a long time to edit all the designs to be how I wanted, the end result was great - which resulted in high number of sales. Although like other years, we didn't have that many pre-orders for the yearbook, we actually sold-out. The students saw our end result and many decided to purchase it on the spot. We became the first yearbook in history to sell out, and this was a huge confidence booster for myself. Also, I felt that we were very organized and planned out our time very early in advance. I sent out weekly emails to dictate what each section should be working on, and how many pages were due.</p>
      <p>Weaknesses: Some of the weaknesses of the yearbook was keeping with the timelines. While we spent a lot of time preparing and planning ahead, we didn't take into account how long it would take to get the parts of the yearbook ready for design - in particular, taking photos of sport teams, clubs, etc. While we would plan a time to take a photo with them, we often had to go two times simply because the entire team didn't have their jerseys, or a vital member of the club wasn't present. </p>
      <p>Opportunities: Some of the opportunities I should have taken were things like actual class time. Due to the nature of the class, it was very difficult for us to get any real work done during class time (from 7:30-8:30). This time period was just too short for us to really be able to open up a brand new page and start working, or it was difficult to get other people to even come in at times. As a result, a lot of our work was done outside of class, particularly after school. If we had tried to focus on smaller bits during the class time - like photo editing for example, we would not have had to work so late into the night.</p>
      <p>Threats: There weren't any 'real' threats for our yearbook, however, one demographic that we were not very successful in selling to was the special-needs students. This is because they produced their own mini yearbook every year. We tried to incorporate more of them in our yearbook, but it was difficult to get photos or write-ups, and we were unable to sell very many to that group of students.</p>
    <p>Overall, I feel that the Yearbook was a huge success, and I learned a great deal about business, and myself.</p>
