				<h1>Winona So's Cover Letter</h1>
				<p>Hi!</p>
				<p>As a recent graduate of the Arts & Business program at the University of Waterloo, I am writing to express my interest in the Graphic Designer, Editorial position at Reddit. Having majored in English and specialized in Digital Arts Communication, I believe my past experiences would make me an excellent candidate for this position.</p>
				<p>During my five years volunteering at Imprint Publications, I had the opportunity to fulfill multiple roles within the organization, including two editor positions: design co-editor and graphics editor. As the design co-editor, I was responsible each week for the layout and design of the newspaper and ensuring that the visuals were consistent across the paper. Deadlines were of utmost importance to us as a newspaper organization as we had to go to print by a specific times.</p>
				<p>In my other role as a graphics editor, I worked with other graphic artists to create infographics and visuals to represent stories accurately and increase reader comprehension. Working with the writers was also important to make sure we created graphics that the writers were happy with. Aside from these two editorial roles, I also volunteered as a proofreader and helped with editing photos, articles, and making sure everything that we produced was up to high quality.</p>
				<p>Reddit is seeking a candidate possessing journalistic experience, creative vision, and understanding of the Reddit community. Given my past experience, and as a long-time user of Reddit, I believe I would be a great asset to the community and team. My portfolio containing pieces of my work at Imprint and other places is available at www.winonaso.com. I would truly love to work for Reddit, and look forward to hearing from you in the future!</p>
				<p>Sincerely,</p>
				<p>Winona So</p>
