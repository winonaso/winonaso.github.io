				<h2>Girl Guides</h2>
				<p>I am proud to say that I was a long-time member of the Girl Guides of Canada. This experience has taught me a multitude of skills, and has shaped who I am today. When I joined in 1999, my friends and I participated in small volunteering activities like helping clean up the community, handing out water at marathons, or planning camp meals. As we matured, we began to give back to the community more, going to Rememberance Day parades, hosting barbeques, and eventaully, becoming junior leaders ourselves.</p>
				<p>During one of my last years as a junior leader, I received the Richard C. C. Tse Oustanding Girl Guide and Scouting award. This was rewarded to someone who possessed leadership, a community and volunteering spirit, and encaptured the Guiding and Scouting spirit. Girl Guides have been a huge part of my life, and I am proud to say that I am a recipient of the Chief Commissioner's Gold Award.</p>

				<h2>General</h2>
				<p>Through Girl Guides, and other community connections, I have volunteered with a large variety of groups in many different forms. Some of the places I've volunteered with are the Multiple Sclerosis Society, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Families with Children across China, the Hands-Across-the-Border event, and the Vancouver Food Bank. Notably, I've also volunteered in the 2010 Winter Olympics held in Vancouver as part of the Opening Ceremony.</p>
				<p>At the University of Waterloo, I've been volunteering with Imprint, the official undergraduate newspaper, participaiting in the editorial roles, as well as a proofreading role. For the past two years, I've volunteered as an orientation leader for the University of Waterloo. This involves a week of running activities, acting as a role model, and answering questions for the first year students. I currently am an upper-year mentor for first year English students.</p>
