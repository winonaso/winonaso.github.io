			<h1>My hobbies</h1>
			<div>
				<h2>Fountain Pens</h2>
				<p>A recent new hobby that I've recently gotten into is fountain pens. There's just something special when you use a beautiful ink with high quality paper that you can't get with a ballpoint. I now own five pens - a Noodler's Ahab, a Lamy Safari, Pilot Metropolitan, and two vintage pens: a Parker 25, and a Shaeffer. As for inks, I have Diamine Aqua Blue, and Noodler's Bernake Black. I'm always looking for an excuse to buy more inks simply because they're gorgeous and fun to write with.</p>

				<h2>Sewing</h2>
				<p>Since I was young, I enjoyed learning how to sew, and I started with small plushies and toys. This past christmas, I received a sewing machine of my own, and have began to sew larger pieces. I've recently started to sew plushies as gifts and aprons.</p>

				<h2>Baking</h2>
				<p>Another favourite hobby of mine is baking. The smell of cookies or cake in my home is not an uncommon smell. My favourite ingredient to bake with are apples, but I'll try to bake anything at least once.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Video Games</h2>
				<p>I play a bunch of video games on my PC; Starcraft 2 (Zerg race!), Diablo 3, Skyrim, as well as Splinter Cell: Blacklist. Aside from PC gaming, I also play a lot of games on my 3DS, my current favourite is Luigi's Mansion, but I also love Virtue's Last Reward, Animal Crossing, and ePicross!</p>
