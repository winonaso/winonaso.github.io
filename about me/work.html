			<h1>Co-operative Education</h1>
			<div>
				<p>In 2010, I began my undergraduate degree at the University of Waterloo as an Arts &amp; Business Co-op student. I major in English in the Rhetoric and Professional Writing department. I also specialize in Digital Arts Communication, a program which focuses on the digital design of hypertext, image, sound, and video. The co-op program allows me to alternate between work terms and school study terms. This lets me try a variety of different jobs at different companies while still studying for my undergraduate degree.</p>

			<h2>Sony Entertainment Network</h2>
				<h3>UI Designer, Fall 2012 and Winter 2013</h3>
				<p>This job introduced me to UI/UX design, and revolved around one of Sony's programs, Media Go. As a UI Designer, I was given much more flexiblity to explore different parts of design that I wished to investigate more. I was also introduced to the agile software development (as well as waterfall) methodologies. During the term, I used various tools such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, as well as Perforce and Git.</p>
				<p>As a UI/UX designer, I wrote use cases, and documentation demonstrating how the project would work. I also created wireframes and workflows based off of user stories. A major part of my job was the actual design of the project, and how it intergrated with the rest of Media Go. I also wrote test cases and helped with the testing of said projects.</p>
				<h4>First Term - Fall 2012</h4>
				<p>One major project that I was involved in was the Media Go website. With my English background, I helped clean up some of the text of the website, fixed various bugs, as well as helped design some new pages. I also worked on the design of two features: the video editing and trimming, and the LRC file creation features.
				<h4>Second Term - Winter 2013</h4>
				<p>During my second term at Sony, I worked on a multitude of various projects. Media Go 2.5 was a major release that happened during my work term, and so part of my term was dedicated to wrapping up designs for those features that I had started in my first work term for release, writing documentation, and testing. </p>

				<h2>Sybase, an SAP Company</h2>
				<h3>Technical Writer, Winter 2012</h3>
				<p>This job introduced me to technical writing, and the Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA).</p>
				<p>Like many writing jobs, there was a large focus on working to and completing deadlines. I was put in charge of creating a new documentation set for a product. This meant I was responsible for creating my own deadlines and milestones, as well as the drafting and proofing of the documents. I rose to the challenge, and at the end of my work term, could report that I had complete the full documentation set.</p>

				<h1>Work Experience</h1>
				<p>I've worked in a variety of different places, in many different roles. My first job was as a <em>graphic artist</em> at The Artona Group, the largest graduation photography company in Vancouver. This was my first taste of what the graphic design's industry as well as my first time in an actual working environment. It was very fast-paced, and I was able to be very creative in that job.</p>
				<p>I've also worked in retail as a <em>salesperson</em>. I developed my people skills and my selling skills. It was a highly stressful environment as I worked during a huge sale period. From this I learned that the business environment is a highly stressful one, and in particular, retail.</p>
				<p>One of my more recent jobs was working as a <em>receptionist</em> for a large equity loan corporation. I was responsible for ordering supplies, redirecting phone calls to brokers, and data entry. In this job, I had to be very careful with all my work because I was working with money and had to be very precise with my data entry. This was also the first time that I was the front line of customer interaction, on the phone lines, as well as in person. I learned how to be professional and present myself in a business environment.</p>
				<p>Each of these places had a different environment, and I learned how to adapt and grow to each situation. As an entrepreneur I must know how to adapt and change the way I act in a business setting, particularly when speaking clients or investors.</p>
