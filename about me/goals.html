			<h1>My Goals</h1>
			<div>
				<h2>Short Term</h2>
				<p>	<p>My short term goal is to become more organized. As shown by my work experience on large-scale projects like the school yearbook or my UI/UX projects, I am quite organized when it comes to the big picture and big deadlines. I can manage breaking up large projects into smaller pieces to allow me to better plan my time.</p>
				<p>However, I feel that I could further improve my organizational skills by focusing more on the small parts instead of only the big picture. I will begin to work on this by splitting up my small projects into more manageable parts with shorter deadlines so that even the little parts have my full attention and full effort put into them.</p>
				<p>Working in an Agile office has improved my organizational skills and time management skills in the short term, and has been a useful tool for me to use moving forward.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Long Term</h2>
				<p>My long term goal is to eventually become editor of a magazine. I loved my time as editor in chief of the school yearbook, and having learned how to use InDesign through Imprint, I am very comfortable with working with layout. I am hoping that I will be able to find jobs in my co-op terms related to this directly, and to further develop my design skills. I feel that although physical magazines are still popular today, that the world is moving towards popularizing  e-books and e-magazines. This will require me to be well versed in both traditional techniques as well as web and e-content techniques.</p>
				<p>One thing that would help push this goal along would be to participate in a Graduate school program related to journalism, or digital design, and I am looking seriously into persuing this after I finish my undergraduate degree.</p>
