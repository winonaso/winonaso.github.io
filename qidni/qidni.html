				Qidni Labs develop advanced renal replacement therapies. We are currently developing a disruptive nanofiltration technology to improve the quality of dialysis for over two million patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) around the world. We have already built and tested the first prototype and we have learnt a lot from that. We are currently developing the second prototype of the device. We are located in Kitchener, Ontario.
