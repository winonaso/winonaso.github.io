				<p>Over two million patients around the world suffer from End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). Patients' survival depends on dialysis, a renal replacement therapy that they undergo until they receive a kidney transplant. The survival rate of patients under dialysis is less than 40% in 5 years (1). A year of dialysis of each patient may cost upwards of $60,000 in Canada and the United States. Patients endure a lot more hardships due to complications and lifestyle restrictions. Studies show that longer treatment times can potentially be associated with prolonged survival (2).

				the solution

			<p>We are working on an implantable renal replacement therapy. Our device would reduce several costs associated with dialysis equipment, caregivers and insurance providers. We are creating an opportunity for patients to have access to renal replacement therapy continuously and at all times.
