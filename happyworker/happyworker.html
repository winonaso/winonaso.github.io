		<h1>Making it Better</h1>
		
		<h2>The Assignment</h2>
		<div id="happyworker" class="section">
			<h3>Happy Worker Trial Project</h3>
			<p>Take a toy or household item (or anything), think of 3+ things you would make better (both aesthetic and/or functional; don't forget the little details) and create a  short, 1 to 2 pg doc explaining to someone exactly what changes/improvements are needed. Tip: Pretend you're writing to someone who doesn't understand English that well; Be as clear as possible, and remember pictures/diagrams often speak louder than words.</p>
		</div>

		<h2>Choosing an object</h2>
		<div id="happyworker" class="section">
			<p>The first step of the project was to choose an object to explain to make better. This was crucial to the project because I had to pick an item that had different parts, but also areas for improvement.</p>
			<p><img src="shower.png" width="600px"></p>
			<p>I decided to go about a day looking at the different things I interacted with on a daily basis, and ended up picking the shower speaker due to the problems I found while using it.</p>
		</div>

		<h2>Initial Draft</h2>
		<div id="happyworker" class="section">
			<p>Whenever starting a new design, I like to start off with paper and pen in order to get some ideas going and some brainstorming.</p>
			<p><img src="draft.png" width="600px"></p>
			<p>As seen above, I originally wanted to use two pages to describe the problems and solutions. While actually working on it though, while describing areas with issues, it seemed silly that I had to refer back and forth between the two pages to look at the problems and think of solutions. I decided to put both on one page in order to make it more user friendly.</p>
		</div>

		<h2>Process</h2>
		<div id="happyworker" class="section">
			<p>I started with the layout of the different elements, and then the copy came afterwards. After working on a layout that I was happy with, I went back and revised the copy so that it was more clear and better reflected the tone of the style.</p>
			<h3>The details</h3>
			<p>Here I've highlighted some of the details in the project.</p>

		</div>

		<h2>Final Version</h2>
		<div id="happyworker" class="section">
			<p>After a few hours, I finished something that I was pretty happy with. See the <a href="winonaso-happyworker.pdf">PDF Copy</a>.</p>
